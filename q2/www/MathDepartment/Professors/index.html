    <<h1>Math Professors</h1>
    <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
    <p>Ada Lovelace was an English Mathematician and writer in the early 1800’s. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be executed. Her work sometimes went unnoticed due to her gender and the little respect women had at the time.
      Yet she was one of the first to recognize a computers full potential at such an early age of time. She also assisted in decoding messages from other governments and military at the time.</p>

    <h2>Alan Turning</h2>
    <p> Alan Turning was a famous mathematician and computer scientist in Britain during the forties. He created different algorithms and formulas in an early general purpose computer. These inventions were during World War II and assisted the British army with understand the codes that the Germany army produced through their Enigma Machine.
      His career ended dramatically due to is homosexuality which was not accepted at the time.</p>
